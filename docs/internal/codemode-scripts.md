# Codemode scripts (gi reference)

Adapted for gi from Pi's codemode reference (pi-coding-agent docs/codemode.md, MIT).

The `codemode` tool runs a JavaScript script that calls gi's other tools and non-LLM models, such as classifiers and image models. Only the script's output reaches the model, so a script can run calls in parallel and filter large results before the model sees them. Turn it on for a session with `/codemode on` (or `defaultTools: ["+codemode"]`, or an MCP server with codemode exposure).

## Scripts

The tool input is raw JavaScript source, not JSON and not a markdown code fence. It runs as the body of an async function in a QuickJS sandbox, so top-level `await` and `return` work. The sandbox has no Node APIs, file system, network, or timers; scripts reach the outside world only through tools and `models`.

A script may start with an options line:

```js
// @options: {"max_output_tokens": 2000, "timeout_ms": 60000}
```

- `max_output_tokens` (default 10000) limits the output. Longer output keeps its start and end, and the full text is saved under `vfs://codemode-output/...`; the result names the path (read it with `read`, using offset/limit).
- `timeout_ms` is a hard deadline for the whole script. It is unset by default. Image generation can take minutes, so do not set a short deadline for scripts that generate images.

The result starts with `Script completed` or `Script failed`, the wall time, and the output. A failed script keeps its partial output, followed by `Script error:` and the error. Tool calls are real: calls made before a failure are not undone. Calls still running when the script ends are cancelled, and unawaited promises are discarded.

## Globals

| Global | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools.<name>(args)` | Call a tool. See [Call tools](#call-tools). |
| `text(value)` | Add a text item to the output. Strings are added as is, other values as JSON. |
| `image(value)` | Add an image: a base64 `data:` URL, an `{ image_url }` object, or an image block `{ type: "image", data, mimeType }` such as those returned by MCP tools and `models.generateImages()`. |
| `console.log(...)` | Like `text()`; `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug` do the same. |
| `return value` | A top-level `return` adds the value like `text()`. |
| `exit()` | End the script successfully. |
| `store(key, value)` / `load(key)` | Keep small JSON values across `codemode` calls in the session. Writes are kept only when the script succeeds. |
| `ALL_TOOLS` | Every callable tool as `{ name, description }`. |
| `searchTools(query, { limit?, namespace? })` | Rank callable tools by relevance (BM25, default limit 8). |
| `describeTool(name)` | A tool's description and TypeScript declaration, or `undefined`. |
| `describeNamespace(name)` | `{ name, description?, instructions?, tools }` for a namespace such as an MCP server, or `undefined`. |
| `models` | List and run non-LLM models. See [Models](#models). |

## Call tools

Every tool the session can call is a method of `tools`, named by its identifier: characters that are not valid in a JavaScript identifier become `_` (the MCP tool `mcp__dev-radius__search` is `tools.mcp__dev_radius__search`). Each method takes one object with the tool's arguments. Reading a member that does not exist throws an error naming close matches; check for a tool with `"name" in tools`.

- MCP tools resolve to their `CallToolResult`, including `isError` and `structuredContent`.
- gi's other tools (`shell`, `read`, `write`, ...) resolve to their text output.

A call that fails, is blocked by a hook, or gets invalid arguments rejects with an `Error` that carries the tool's error text. Use `Promise.allSettled()` to keep the results of the calls that succeed.

## Models

`models` reaches the model catalog and runs non-LLM models with gi's credentials for the provider (auth.json, else the provider's environment variable): classifiers, which answer typed questions about JSON state, and image models, which generate images. Chat models are listed but cannot be run from scripts.

```ts
type ModelType = "chat" | "image" | "classifier";

/** A catalog entry. `provider` and `id` identify it; other fields depend on the type. */
interface ModelInfo {
  type?: ModelType;
  provider: string;
  id: string;
  name: string;
  api: string;
  input: ("text" | "image")[];
  contextWindow?: number;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

declare const models: {
  /** Every known model of a type, optionally for one provider. */
  getModelsOfType(type: ModelType, provider?: string): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;
  /** Models of a type whose provider has working credentials. */
  getAvailableOfType(type: ModelType, provider?: string): Promise<ModelInfo[]>;
  /** One catalog entry, or undefined. */
  getModelOfType(type: ModelType, provider: string, id: string): Promise<ModelInfo | undefined>;
  /** Answer `context.questions` about `context.state`; answers are in `result.answers` by question ID. */
  classify(model: ModelInfo, context: ClassifierContext): Promise<ClassifierResult>;
  /** Generate images from `context.input` text and image blocks; show `result.output` blocks with image(). Can take minutes. */
  generateImages(model: ModelInfo, context: ImagesContext): Promise<ImagesResult>;
};
```

`classify()` and `generateImages()` use only the `provider` and `id` of `model`, so `{ provider, id }` works as well. They do not throw on provider errors: check `stopReason` and `errorMessage`. At most four such calls run at once per script; more calls wait for a free slot, so `Promise.all()` over many items is fine. Their usage counts toward the turn's cost.

Model IDs differ between providers, for example `typesafe/jev-latest` and `openrouter/typesafe/jev-1.13`. Use `models.getAvailableOfType(type)` to find the IDs that work with the current credentials.

### Classify

```ts
interface ClassifierContext {
  /** The data to classify. */
  state: Record<string, unknown>;
  /** Questions by ID. One call answers all of them. */
  questions: Record<string, ClassifierQuestion>;
}

type ClassifierQuestion =
  /** Pick one label. `criteria` maps each label to what it means. */
  | { type: "choice"; instructions: string; criteria: Record<string, string> }
  /** Score on an ordered scale. `criteria` describes each level, lowest first. */
  | { type: "score"; instructions: string; criteria: string[] }
  /** Yes or no. */
  | { type: "bool"; instructions: string; criteria: { true: string; false: string } };

interface ClassifierResult {
  provider: string;
  model: string;
  /** Answers by question ID. */
  answers: Record<string, ClassifierAnswer>;
  usage?: ModelUsage;
  stopReason: "stop" | "error" | "aborted";
  errorMessage?: string;
}

type ClassifierAnswer =
  | { type: "choice"; choice: string; probabilities: Record<string, number>; confidence: number }
  /** `score` is the expected level index, from 0 to `criteria.length - 1`. */
  | { type: "score"; score: number; confidence: number }
  /** Probability of `true`. */
  | { type: "bool"; probability: number };

/** Token counts and cost in USD, when the service reports them. */
type ModelUsage = { input: number; output: number; totalTokens: number; cost: { total: number } };
```

Classify several items by calling `classify()` once per item. This script sorts feedback messages, for example ones a tool returned earlier in the script:

```js
const jev = await models.getModelOfType("classifier", "typesafe", "jev-latest");
const results = await Promise.all(
  messages.map((message) =>
    models.classify(jev, {
      state: { message },
      questions: {
        sentiment: {
          type: "choice",
          instructions: "How does the user feel about the product?",
          criteria: { positive: "Satisfied or happy", negative: "Unhappy or frustrated", neutral: "Neither" },
        },
        urgency: {
          type: "score",
          instructions: "How urgently does this need a reply?",
          criteria: ["no reply needed", "reply this week", "reply today"],
        },
      },
    }),
  ),
);
return results.map((result, i) =>
  result.stopReason === "stop"
    ? { message: messages[i], sentiment: result.answers.sentiment.choice, urgency: result.answers.urgency.score }
    : { message: messages[i], error: result.errorMessage },
);
```

### Generate images

```ts
interface ImagesContext {
  /** The prompt as text blocks, plus image blocks to edit or use as references. */
  input: (TextBlock | ImageBlock)[];
}

interface ImagesResult {
  provider: string;
  model: string;
  /** Generated images, and text blocks for models that also return text. */
  output: (TextBlock | ImageBlock)[];
  usage?: ModelUsage;
  stopReason: "stop" | "error" | "aborted";
  errorMessage?: string;
}

type TextBlock = { type: "text"; text: string };
/** `data` is base64. */
type ImageBlock = { type: "image"; data: string; mimeType: string };
```

Show generated images with `image(block)`. Do not print `data` with `text()`, `console`, or `return`: it is large and the model cannot read it as text. Generated images are not saved to disk; to keep one, write it to a file with a tool.

```js
// @options: {"timeout_ms": 300000}
const painter = await models.getModelOfType("image", "openrouter", "google/gemini-2.5-flash-image");
const result = await models.generateImages(painter, {
  input: [{ type: "text", text: "A red fox in the snow, watercolor" }],
});
if (result.stopReason !== "stop") return result.errorMessage;
for (const block of result.output) {
  if (block.type === "image") image(block);
  else text(block.text);
}
```

## Limits

- A script's VM has 256 MB of memory. Running out throws `InternalError: out of memory`; filter or aggregate large data instead of accumulating it.
- Scripts cannot start other `codemode` scripts.
- The store keeps at most 262144 characters of JSON per value and 1048576 in total.
