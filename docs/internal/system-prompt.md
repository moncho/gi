# System prompt (#32)

gi builds its system prompt as Pi does (`core/system-prompt.js`): named,
ordered sections, each replaceable on its own.

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| `preamble` | gi's: `You are <assistant>, an expert coding assistant operating inside gi, a coding agent harness. You help <user> by …` (no tags) |
| `tools` | `- <name>: <snippet>` for each declared tool with a snippet, then Pi's line about other custom tools |
| `rules` | Pi's `buildRules`: the shell rule (`Use shell for file operations like ls, rg, find` when no grep/find/ls tool), the declared tools' guidelines, gi's rules, then Pi's `Be concise in your responses` and `Show file paths clearly when working with files`; trimmed and deduplicated |
| `docs` | gi's: where gi's reference lives (`vfs://reference/...`) |
| `project_context` | the workspace `AGENTS.md`, in Pi's `<project_instructions path="…">` form |
| `skills` | Pi's `formatSkillsForPrompt` (`<available_skills>` with name, description, location) |
| `cwd` | the workspace root |
| `mcp_servers` | MCP servers reached through codemode or `tool_search` ([mcp.md](mcp.md)) |

Every section but the preamble is wrapped in `<name>…</name>`; sections are
joined by blank lines. `internal/prompt` is the builder;
`TestBuildSectionsMatchesPi` compares every section except the preamble and
docs (gi's wording) with Pi's own output (`scripts/golden-system-prompt.mjs`).

A configured `SystemPrompt` (for example the acceptance fixture) is Pi's
`customPrompt`: it replaces the preamble, and the tools, rules and docs
sections are left out.

## Tool contributions

A tool contributes a snippet and guidelines while it is declared
(`RegisteredTool.PromptSnippet` / `PromptGuidelines`; built-in tools fall back
to the table in `internal/turn/prompt_sections.go`):

- `read`, `write`, `edit`, `tool_search`: Pi's text;
- `codemode`: Pi's snippet and guideline (`vendor/codemode-texts.json`);
- gi's tools (`shell`, `rtk`, `tools`, `skills`, `messages`, `script`,
  `compact`, `peering`): gi's text. MCP tools have none.

Because the tools section follows the declared tools, switching codemode on
or loading tools changes the prompt from the next turn, as in Pi.

## Changes mid-conversation

The sections when a session starts lead the conversation. Each turn the
engine builds the sections again; a change is recorded once (Pi's
`diffSystemPromptSections`) and sent as a system message before the prompt
whose turn introduced it, with pi-ai's text:

```
Updated system prompt section "tools":

<tools>
…
</tools>
```

(`Removed system prompt section "<name>".` for a removed section). Updates
keep their position on later turns, so earlier messages stay cached. The
initial sections and the updates are kept in the session state
(`system_prompt_sections`); stored messages are unchanged.

- Models whose compat does not declare `supportsMidConvoSystemMessages` get
  the updates folded into the leading prompt instead (pi-ai's
  `collapseSystemMessages`: a replaced section keeps its place, a new one
  goes last).
- If compaction removes an update's anchor, the update moves into the leading
  prompt.
- A hook that replaces the system prompt (`before_agent_start`, `context`,
  `before_provider_request`) replaces it whole; updates are then not added.
- Sessions recorded before this prompt start with the new sections as their
  initial ones.

## Not ported

- Pi loads `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` from the agent directory and every
  ancestor directory; gi uses the workspace `AGENTS.md`.
- Pi's `SYSTEM.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` prompt files and extension-defined
  sections.
